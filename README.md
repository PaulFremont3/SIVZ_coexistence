This repository contains all data and code needed to reproduce the figures and tables in the paper:

Fr√©mont *et al.*, *Mechanisms of Coexistence Between Photosynthetic Marine Microorganisms, Their Viruses, and Grazers: Toward Integration in Ocean Ecosystem Models*.

### Download
`git clone https://github.com/PaulFremont3/SIVZ_coexistence/`

### Tutorial
The folder `Codes/` contains two subfolder: `Models/` and `trait_data/`. The folder `trait_data/` contains codes and data for the generation of pdfs necessary to generate figure S1 to S4 (life history trait models) and the folder `Models/` contains all codes and example data for the generation of pdfs necessary to generate all other figures, tables and supplementary figures.

Each subfolder contains a `README.md` that:
1. Describes each files
2. Explain how to run the codes
3. Explain where the figure panels are in the generated pdfs and data for tables

**Note**: The code generates additional outputs beyond those presented in the paper.
