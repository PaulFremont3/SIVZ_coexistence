Two subdirectories:

Models/ : all python and R codes to run the SVZ, SVRZ, SIVZ, and SIVRZ models simulations, the parameter optimization to target concentration and histograms of measured abundances from Carlson et al. 2022

trait_data/ : all R codes to generate life history trait models

In each subdirectory is a README.md describing precisely how to run the scripts, the pdfs it generates and where the panel of each figure in the paper can be found.

The scripts from the two subdirectory can be run independently from each other (the scripts in Models take some data generated in trait_data as input but they are already pre-generated)
